# Instapure (Instagram Video Downloader)

This project is an educational demonstration of building a web application to
download Instagram videos using Next.js. The primary goal is to explore modern
web development techniques, including server-side rendering/components, API
interaction (potentially via Next.js API routes), state management, form
handling, and building a clean UI with Shadcn/ui.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Downloading
videos from Instagram may violate their Terms of Service. Please respect
copyright laws and the platform's policies. Use this tool responsibly and only
for content you have the right to download.

## ✨ Features

- **Download Instagram Videos:** Input an Instagram video URL to fetch and
  download the video file. (Note: Functionality depends on the backend
  implementation, which isn't detailed here but is a core part of the learning
  experience).
- **Modern Frontend Stack:** Built with the latest Next.js (App Router).
- **Clean UI:** User interface crafted using [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  components and styled with Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Responsive Layout:** Ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience
  across different screen sizes.
- **Type-Safe:** Written entirely in TypeScript.
- **Form Handling & Validation:** Robust input handling using React Hook Form
  and Zod for schema validation.
- **Client-Side Caching:** Efficient data fetching and state management with
  TanStack Query (React Query).
- **Theming:** Supports light and dark mode using `next-themes`.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Setup for multi-language support using
  `next-intl`.
- **User Feedback:** Uses `sonner` for toast notifications.
- **Optimized Development:** Utilizes Next.js Turbopack (`--turbopack`) for
  faster development builds.

## 📚 Educational Goals

This project serves as a learning resource for understanding:

- **Next.js Fundamentals:** App Router, Server Components, Client Components,
  API Routes (if implemented for backend logic), SSR/SSG concepts.
- **UI Development:** Building composable and accessible UI components with
  Shadcn/ui, Radix UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **State Management:** Managing server state, caching, and background updates
  with TanStack Query.
- **Form Management:** Implementing complex forms with validation using React
  Hook Form and Zod.
- **API Integration:** Fetching data from external sources or custom backend
  endpoints. (The specifics of interacting with Instagram are a key learning
  challenge).
- **TypeScript:** Leveraging static typing in a full-stack React framework.
- **Modern Styling:** Using Tailwind CSS v4 features and utilities like `clsx`
  and `tailwind-merge`.
- **Internationalization:** Setting up and managing translations with
  `next-intl`.
- **Project Structure & Tooling:** Organizing a Next.js application, using
  ESLint and Prettier for code quality.
